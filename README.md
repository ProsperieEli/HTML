            <h1 id="begin">Welcome To My Portfolio.</h1>
            <p id="Start">My name is Elijah Prosperie. At the time of making this website, I am twenty-one(21) years old<br> and I am enrolled in the Alchemy Coding Labs Full-Stack Developer program.<br>
                Before going further, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this webpage. It is my first<br> project even before beginning my classes. What you will see down below<br>
                will be a mix of talents and skills that I have aquitted over the course of my semester. <br> This Website will act as a hub for my portfolio, as well as give insight to why I would be a good<br>
                choice for you and your company! Thank you once again for reading and I hope to speak with you more in depth soon.</p>

            <h2>What do I know?</h2>
            <P>During my time at Alchemy, I've learned skills that are excellent in <em>both</em> front-end <strong>and</strong> back-end jobs.<br>
                This includes a vast understanding and knowledge in:
                <ul>
                    <strong><li>HTML5</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Node.Js</li>
                    <li>SQL</li> </strong>

                </ul>
                My time at Alchemy has prepared me not to be a good software engineer, but to be the best and most versatile programmer I can be, <br>
                that is suited to handle your companies needs.
            
            </P>
